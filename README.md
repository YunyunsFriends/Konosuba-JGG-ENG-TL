## Konosuba Judgment on this Greedy Game English Menu Patch for PC, Switch, and PS Vita Proof of Concept
This patch adds a partial English menu and 8 machine translated scripts on PC and Switch. (7 for PS Vita)
###
We are looking for translators to translate the rest of the vn's scripts, and will not be able to finish the patch without them because we do not want to machine translate the entire game.

## PC Patch Features
- Translated Menus and System text.
- A slightly modified font to fit more text on screen.
- Enabled Debug Menu. ~(Mostly broken)~ Fix provided by nikvoid. Thank you!
- ~Changed the supported video container to .mp4 for Steam Deck / Linux compatibility, and so one video file can be used for PS4, Switch, and PC.~ Temporarily removed from POC patch.
- Reduced font size.
## Switch Patch
- The Switch patch is a partial conversion of the PC patch and will have non-working options exposed.
- The "Game Over" button will call a debug function to trip all the flags in the game. (This can lead to spoilers!)
- The Debug Menu is not enabled.
- You will need to have a Switch with cfw to install the patch. Extract it to the root of your sd card.
- Reduced font size.
## Vita Patch
- Contains 7 machine translated scripts. No textures or menus were edited.
- Reduced font size. _Note: Unlike PC and Switch the font on Vita has not been fixed. I.E some letters may be cut off on some edges._
## Where to buy the game

## FAQ
### Do you plan to patch the Vita and PS4 versions?
If we get translators on board to help with this project yes. Those versions of the game have various differences that we would need to make adjustments for due to differences in textures and the resolution on Vita.
### Do I need the game?
Yes, the files in releases are what's strictly needed for the patch.
### Can I play this on a Steam Deck?
Yes, you will need to install **[GE-Proton](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom)** using ProtonUp-Qt and add Konosuba: JGG to Steam and launch it. Then install this version of **[DirectX](https://lutris.net/files/tools/directx-2010.tar.gz)** to Konosuba: JGG's prefix using WineTrick's run exe on prefix feature.
