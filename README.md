## Konosuba Judgment on this Greedy Game Prologue English Patch for PC & Switch DEMO
This patch adds a English menu and translates all the prologue scripts on PC and Switch.
###
We are looking for translators to help translate the rest of the vn's scripts.

### PC Patch Features
- Translated Menus and System text.
- A slightly modified font/text box to fit more text on screen.
- Reduced font size.
### Switch Patch
- The Switch patch is a partial conversion of the PC patch and will have non-working options exposed.
- The "Game Over" button will call a debug function to trip all the flags in the game. _(This can lead to spoilers.)_
- Reduced font size.
###
_You will need to have a Switch with [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) cfw to install the patch. Extract it to the root of your sd card._
### Vita Patch
- Contains 7 machine translated scripts. No textures or menus were edited.
- Reduced font size. _Note: Unlike PC and Switch the font on Vita has not been fixed. I.E some letters may be cut off on some edges._
## Where to buy the game
###
Windows: **[DMM DLSOFT](https://dlsoft.dmm.com/detail/images_0013/)**
- You need to use a vpn set to Japan to view and purchase the game due to the page being blocked outside of Japan.
###
Nintendo Switch: **[eShop](https://store-jp.nintendo.com/list/software/70010000035750.html)**
- You will need a Japanese eshop account to purchase the game.
## FAQ
### Do you plan to patch the Vita and PS4 versions?
Those versions of the game have various differences that we would need to make adjustments for due to differences in textures and the resolution on Vita. The plan is to support those platforms after the PC and Switch release.
### Do I need the game?
Yes, the files in releases are what's strictly needed for the patch. **If you try to run the executable in the patch files without overwriting the game files you will get a black screen.**
### Can I play this on a Steam Deck?
Yes, an install script is available for [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) on the game's [page](https://lutris.net/games/konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world-jud/). Once installed the version of proton will need to be changed to the latest version of lutris-GE-Proton so audio and videos work properly.
